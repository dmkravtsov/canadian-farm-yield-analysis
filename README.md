# 🌾 Canadian Farm Yield Analysis

This project explores and models agricultural productivity across Canadian provinces using interpretable machine learning methods.

## 📊 Project Structure
- **1_eda.ipynb** — Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): data structure, distributions, correlations.
- **2_model.ipynb** — Modeling pipeline: XGBoost, SHAP, GAM, DML, and Causal Forests for yield prediction.
- **OLS Regression Summary** — provides interpretable coefficient-based insights.
- **Dataset:** `enhanced_canadian_farm_production_dataset.csv` *(not uploaded due to size; available [upon request or via Google Drive link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aryan208/canadian-farm-production-dataset-19202024)).*

## ⚙️ Methods Used
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
- **Machine Learning Models:** XGBoost, GAM, OLS
- **Causal Inference Models:** Double ML, Causal Forest
- **Explainability:** SHAP, Partial Dependence, Marginal Effects

## 🚀 Key Insights
- Rainfall and temperature are dominant climatic predictors.
- Crop type drives most of the yield variance (Corn, Potatoes, Sugar Beets top performers).
- Modern ML and causal models provide consistent, interpretable evidence across methods.
